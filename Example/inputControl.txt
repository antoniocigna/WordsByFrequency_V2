// you need a lemma file, format is word \t lemma   (lemma is the word you look for in the dictionary), if the lemma for a word is missing then is assumed to be equal to the word
//
// dictionary words and sentences translation will be used and built if missing 
// the words and sentences  translation will be built when needed:
//	 when same words or sentences translation are missing it will be asked to copy them from an automatic traslator (eg. Google)
//    
// new translation built a new dictionary file is built, the file name is "dictL" + time for the words and "dictR" + time for the sentences
//  
// we can have several of these  files that are read at the beginning of the run
// every creation of dictionary file, will rewrite a file containing all the dictionary files: "newLemmaTranDict.txt" and "newRowDict.txt"

// when you want to clean the folder, you can delete all "dictL...txt" and "dictR...txt" files and then rename the new...txt file in "dictL...txt" and "dictR...txt"
